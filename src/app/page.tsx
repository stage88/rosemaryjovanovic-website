          <h2>My name is Rosemary Jovanovic, I am a Canberra based Psychologist.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I am an accredited Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) Instructor and a Registered
          Psychologist. I have worked with children, adolescents and young adults for over 20 years
          as School Psychologist, Psychologist in private practice and High School teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about helping people understand mental illness and how to support people
          experiencing mental health problems. You can contact me if you would like me to conduct a
          YMHFA course for your organisation, workplace or school. This course is suitable for any
          person working or living with young people.
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>Anxiety</h3>
        <p>
          Help for social anxiety, health anxiety, worry and generalised anxiety, panic attacks,
          OCD, and phobias. Clear your mind and find your calm with our effective therapies.
        </p>

        <h3>Trauma</h3>
        <p>
          Trauma sustained as a child or adult can have ongoing effects in every aspect of your
          life, your relationships and your sense of yourself. Get help today.
        </p>

        <h3>Grief and loss</h3>
        <p>
          Help heal the pain of grief and loss for a person, pet, role or other life change. You are
